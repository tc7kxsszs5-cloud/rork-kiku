Notes on CSV structure:
- year: Calendar year
- scenario: conservative/base/optimistic
- users_total: Total registered families (free + premium)
- users_premium: Paying subscribers (Premium + Family combined)
- conversion_rate: Percentage of free users who convert to paid
- revenue: Annual revenue from subscriptions (USD)
- capex: Capital expenditures (infrastructure setup development tools)
- opex: Operating expenses (total)
- team_costs: Salaries and benefits for all employees
- team_size: Number of full-time employees
- infra_costs: Cloud infrastructure (AWS EKS S3 RDS ElastiCache etc.)
- ml_costs: ML inference compute costs (model serving GPU/CPU)
- moderation_costs: Human moderation team (contractors + tools)
- marketing_costs: User acquisition (paid ads partnerships content)
- other_opex: Office legal compliance customer support R&D misc
- total_costs: capex + opex (sum of all costs)
- gross_profit: revenue - COGS (infra + ml + moderation costs represent ~25% of revenue)
- ebitda: revenue - total_costs (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization)
- notes: Commentary and context for each year/scenario

Calculation notes:
- COGS = infra_costs + ml_costs + moderation_costs (approximately 25% of revenue at scale)
- Gross Margin = (revenue - COGS) / revenue = ~75%
- EBITDA = revenue - total_costs
- Break-even when EBITDA > 0
- CAC = marketing_costs / new_users (not shown in CSV but can be calculated)
- LTV = ARPU * average_customer_lifetime (4 years assumed)
- ARPU = revenue / users_premium

Assumptions:
- Premium tier: $49/year average (some pay monthly at $4.99*12=$60 some annual at $49)
- Family plan: $99/year (30% of premium users upgrade)
- Blended ARPU: ~$50-55/user depending on mix
- Team costs assume average $100K-$150K blended (engineers higher support lower)
- Marketing costs decrease as % of revenue as scale and organic growth improve
- Infrastructure costs scale sub-linearly with users (economies of scale)
- ML costs increase with uploads but optimize over time (better models lower inference time)
- Moderation costs scale with content volume but automation improves (target 80% auto-approve)

Risk factors reflected in scenarios:
- Conservative: 50% slower user growth 30% lower conversion 20% higher CAC
- Base: Realistic median case used for planning
- Optimistic: 50% faster growth 30% higher conversion 20% lower CAC viral effects
