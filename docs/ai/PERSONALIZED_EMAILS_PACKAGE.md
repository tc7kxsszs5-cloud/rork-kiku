### Email 1: Reach Capital (EdTech специализация)

**Subject:** KIDS: AI-powered child safety platform - Seed opportunity

```
Hi [Name from LinkedIn/Crunchbase],

I noticed Reach Capital's investment in [EdTech company from portfolio - 
например, ClassDojo, Outschool, или другой EdTech из их портфеля] - 
that's why I'm reaching out about KIDS, an AI-powered child safety platform 
we're building.

**The Problem:** Every third child faces online threats - cyberbullying, 
grooming, inappropriate content. Current solutions are reactive and ineffective, 
leaving millions of children unprotected.

**Our Solution:** KIDS combines real-time AI protection with education, 
teaching children safe behavior while protecting them. Unlike existing solutions, 
we're the only platform that combines proactive AI protection with educational 
content. Our goal: become the pre-installed safety standard on all platforms.

**Why Reach Capital:** Given your focus on EdTech and child-focused solutions 
like [конкретный пример из портфеля], I thought KIDS might be a great fit. 
We're at the intersection of education, safety, and technology - exactly what 
Reach Capital invests in.

**Traction:** 
- MVP is ready and working
- Production-ready code, COPPA/GDPR-K compliant
- Open Source approach for transparency
- Ready to scale

**The Ask:** We're seeking $500K-$1M (Seed round) to integrate on iOS, Android, 
browsers, and messengers, and scale to protect millions of children.

I'd love to share our vision and see if there's a fit. Would you be open 
to a 15-minute call next week?

### Email 2: GSV Ventures (EdTech и learning)

**Subject:** KIDS: Child safety meets education - Seed investment opportunity

```
Hi [Name],

I saw GSV Ventures' investment in [EdTech/Learning company - например, 
Coursera, Udemy, или другой learning platform] and thought you might be 
interested in KIDS, an AI-powered child safety platform that combines 
protection with education.

**The Opportunity:** The child safety market is $2.5B+ and growing 15% annually.

**Why GSV Ventures:** Your focus on the "Future of Work and Learning" aligns 
perfectly with KIDS. We're not just protecting children - we're educating them 
for a safer digital future. Plus, our goal of becoming the pre-installed safety 
standard on all platforms creates massive scale potential.

**Our Approach:**
- Real-time AI protection (proactive, not reactive)
- Education + protection (unique combination)
- Pre-installation strategy (become the standard)
- Open Source (transparency and trust)

**Traction:** MVP ready, production-ready code, seeking $500K-$1M (Seed) for 
integrations and scaling.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss? I'm happy to share our pitch deck 
and demo.
