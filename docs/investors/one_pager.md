## Rork-Kiku: AI-Powered Safe Media Sharing for Families

### The Problem
95% of parents worry about their children's online safety, yet existing solutions are inadequate. Kids receive inappropriate content (NSFW, violence, harmful text) through messaging apps with zero parental control. Current parental control tools are either too restrictive (full device lock) or too permissive (basic filtering that doesn't work).

### Our Solution
**Rork-Kiku** is a mobile app where parents share photos and videos with their children through an AI-powered moderation layer. Every piece of content is automatically analyzed for inappropriate material (NSFW, violence, harmful text) before being shown to the child. Parents maintain full control over moderation sensitivity levels.

**How it works**:
1. Parent uploads photo → AI analyzes content (< 10 seconds)
2. Auto-approve if safe (confidence > 90%), auto-reject if unsafe (< 50%), or send to human review (50-90%)
3. Only approved content reaches the child
4. Parent receives notification about moderation status

### Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: $5B (100M families globally with children 5-14 years)
- **SAM**: $3B (US, EU, Asia developed markets)
- **SOM**: $15M-60M ARR by Year 5 (0.5%-2% market share)
- **Growth**: Parental control market growing at 15% CAGR, reaching $6.5B by 2030

### Business Model
**Freemium subscription**:
- Free: 1 child profile, 50 photos/month, basic moderation
- Premium: $4.99/month — unlimited profiles, unlimited media, all moderation levels
- Family: $9.99/month — up to 5 parent accounts, unlimited everything, advanced features

**Unit Economics** (Year 3 target):
- ARPU: $50/year
- CAC: $30
- LTV: $150 (3-year lifetime, 70% retention)
- LTV/CAC: 5x
- Gross margin: 75%

### Competitive Advantage
Unlike Bark, Qustodio, or Google Family Link that focus on device monitoring and restrictions, we provide **AI-first content moderation** specifically for family media sharing. We're privacy-first (GDPR/COPPA compliant), modern UX (React Native), and purpose-built for families—not a social network.
