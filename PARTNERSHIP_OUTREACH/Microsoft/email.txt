SUBJECT: Partnership Opportunity: KIKU - AI-Powered Child Safety Platform for Microsoft Ecosystem

Dear Microsoft Partnerships Team,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Galoian Mikheil, and I am the founder of KIKU (KIDS by KIKU), an innovative AI-powered child safety platform currently in active development, designed to protect children aged 4-15 years in the digital world.

About KIKU - Project in Development

KIKU is a comprehensive child safety solution that uses artificial intelligence to monitor and prevent online threats in children's messaging apps. Our platform is currently at 80% completion (Late MVP / Pre-Production stage) and provides:

- AI-powered message monitoring - Real-time analysis of text messages for threats, bullying, grooming, self-harm, and dangerous content
- Image filtering - AI analysis of images to detect inappropriate content (violence, nudity, extremism, weapons, drugs)
- SOS button - Emergency help with geolocation at one tap, instant notification to parents
- Time restrictions - Customizable usage limits and schedules for healthy digital balance
- Contact whitelist - Manage allowed contacts with ability to block unknown interlocutors
- Data encryption - All data stored locally on device with encryption for maximum privacy
- COPPA/GDPR-K compliant - Full compliance with international child data protection standards with detailed consent logging

Why Microsoft Partnership?

We believe that KIKU aligns perfectly with Microsoft's mission to empower every person and organization to achieve more, especially in the realm of child safety and education. Our platform could:

1. Microsoft Family Safety - Integrate our AI monitoring capabilities
2. Microsoft Store - Distribution through Windows and Microsoft ecosystem
3. Microsoft Education - Integration with Microsoft Teams for Education and Office 365
4. Azure AI Services - Leverage Microsoft's AI/ML services (Azure Cognitive Services)
5. Microsoft for Startups - Participate in startup programs and accelerators
6. Windows Parental Controls - Enhance Windows family features
