I am **Galoian Mikheil**, and I am actively developing my project **KIKU** — an innovative platform for protecting children in the digital world. The project is currently in an active development phase, and I am working on its implementation and realization.

I would very much like to meet supporters and people full of enthusiasm who share the passion for bringing this project to life. I am seeking co-founders and individuals who are interested in participating in the realization of what I believe is a significant and large-scale project that requires special efforts and expertise.

I am looking for experienced people who are ready to start at the early stages of development and implementation. I need help with technical support, providing technical expertise and implementation, as well as new ideas and fresh perspectives that can enhance the product with innovative approaches and ways of realization. I am also open to suggestions for adding new features and improving existing ones.

I am deeply grateful to everyone who wants to help in the realization, creation, and development of this project. Your support, expertise, and enthusiasm are invaluable to making KIKU a success.
