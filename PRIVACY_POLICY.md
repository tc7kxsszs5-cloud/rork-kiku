## Introduction

KIKU ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy and safety of children and their families. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use the KIKU mobile application (the "App").

## Compliance

KIKU is designed to comply with:
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA)
- Apple's App Store Review Guidelines

## Information We Collect

### From Parents/Guardians
- Account information (name, email address)
- Guardian contact details for emergency alerts
- Parental control preferences and settings
- Device information and identifiers

### From Children (with Parental Consent)
- Name and date of birth (for age-appropriate filtering)

- Photos and images (for content moderation)
- Chat messages (for threat detection)

## How We Use Information

We use collected information solely for:
1. **Safety Monitoring**: Analyzing messages, images, and voice content for threats, bullying, and inappropriate content
2. **Emergency Response**: Providing precise location during SOS alerts
3. **Parental Controls**: Enforcing time limits, contact restrictions, and content filtering
4. **Age-Appropriate Filtering**: Customizing safety rules based on child's age group
5. **Compliance**: Maintaining audit logs for legal compliance

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: All user data is primarily stored locally on the device using encrypted storage
- **No Cloud Storage**: We do not transmit or store messages, images, or personal content on external servers
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Parental controls are protected by authentication and optional biometric security

## Parental Rights

Parents and guardians have the right to:
- Review all information collected about their child
- Request deletion of their child's information
- Revoke consent for data collection at any time
- Export all collected data
- Update or correct information

- Parents can review, modify, or delete their child's information at any time
