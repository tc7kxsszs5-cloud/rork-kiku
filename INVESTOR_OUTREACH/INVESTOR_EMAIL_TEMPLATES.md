**To:**

- GSV Ventures – info@gsvventures.com  

**Subject:**  
`KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning platform (Seed round, US focus)`

**Body:**

Hi [Name/Team],

My name is Galoian Mikheil, I’m the founder of KIKU and the creator of KIDS by KIKU – 
a family app that combines online safety, healthy screen use and learning support 
for children, without turning parents into full‑time spies.

KIDS by KIKU monitors chats, messengers and games with AI, flags risky situations 
(bullying, grooming, self‑harm, explicit content) and gives parents clear, 
actionable alerts and SOS flows – while keeping the child’s experience human and 
age‑appropriate.

In the US, we already see state‑level child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) 
that push platforms to add real age‑based controls and safety tooling. 
KIDS by KIKU is built as a practical layer for this reality: 
age‑aware restrictions, AI‑based risk scoring, audit logs and a parent dashboard 
that can sit on top of Apple/Google/Microsoft ecosystems and messaging platforms.

Where we are now:
- Working React Native (Expo) MVP with AI moderation and SOS mechanics
- Architecture ready for mobile + web + tRPC backend and PostgreSQL
- Clear KPI model around family activation, retention and prevented incidents

We’re preparing a $500k–$1M seed round to:
- Ship a production‑ready version for the first 10–20k families
- Run pilots with schools / platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Formalize and track safety and engagement KPIs at a level investors can underwrite

I know your time and pipeline are limited, so I’ll keep it simple:
if this fits your EdTech / child safety / infrastructure thesis, 
I’d be happy to send a 1‑page overview and a short product demo, 
and explore a 20–30 minute call in the next couple of weeks.

Best,

## 2. Impact funds – Omidyar Network / Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

**Channels:**
- Omidyar Network – application / contact form on their website  
- Chan Zuckerberg Initiative – program/contact forms for Education / Child Development  

**Suggested subject (if there is a subject field):**  
`KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning platform for families (US & global)`

**Message / Project description text:**

KIDS by KIKU is a mobile and web app for families that acts as a safety and growth layer 
for children in the digital world.

We combine:
- AI‑based monitoring of chats, messengers and games
- Age‑aware restrictions and risk scoring
- SOS flows for the child and clear alerts for the parent
- A transparent parent dashboard instead of pure surveillance

The goal is to protect children from online harm (bullying, grooming, self‑harm, 
explicit content) and at the same time to support learning and healthy screen habits.

In the US we already see state‑level child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) 
that require real age‑based controls and tooling for parents and platforms. 
KIDS by KIKU is designed as practical infrastructure for this: 
age‑based controls, risk analytics and auditable logs that families and platforms can plug into.

We are currently preparing a $500k–$1M seed round to:
- Bring KIDS by KIKU from MVP to a robust product for the first 10–20k families
- Run pilots with schools and platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Formalize and track safety and engagement KPIs (activation, retention, prevented incidents)

**Subject:**  
`KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning for families (EdTech seed)`

**Body:**

Hi [Name/Team],

I’m Galoian Mikheil, founder of KIKU and creator of KIDS by KIKU – 
a family‑first child safety and learning app.

We help parents and schools:
- See and respond to online risks in chats/messengers/games (AI‑based moderation)
- Set age‑appropriate boundaries instead of pure blocking
- Support healthier screen use and learning for K‑12‑age children

Technically, we run on React Native (Expo) with a backend ready for tRPC/Hono/PostgreSQL, 
and we’re designing our KPIs around family activation, retention and prevented incidents.

In the US, new child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) are creating pressure 
for real age‑based controls and safety tooling. KIDS by KIKU is positioned as a practical 
infrastructure layer for this: age‑aware controls, risk analytics and auditable logs 
for families and platforms.

We are preparing a $500k–$1M seed round focused on:
- Moving from MVP to a stable product for the first 10–20k US families
- Running pilots with schools and platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Hardening our safety and engagement KPIs for the next funding stages

If this is relevant to your EdTech / child safety / infrastructure thesis, 
I’d be glad to share a concise one‑pager and product demo, 
and discuss whether there is a fit for a 20–30 minute call.

Best regards,
