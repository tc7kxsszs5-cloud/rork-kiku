SUBJECT: KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning for families (EdTech seed)

Hi [Name/Team],

I'm Galoian Mikheil, founder of KIKU and creator of KIDS by KIKU – 
a family‑first child safety and learning app.

We help parents and schools:
- See and respond to online risks in chats/messengers/games (AI‑based moderation)
- Set age‑appropriate boundaries instead of pure blocking
- Support healthier screen use and learning for K‑12‑age children

Our go‑to‑market strategy:
- **Free for families** at launch – our focus is rapid user acquisition and building critical mass
- We're targeting both parents and children as active users (doubling our addressable audience)
- This dual‑user model makes KIDS by KIKU unique: 1 family = 2–4 active users (parent + children)
- Future monetization: premium features (advanced analytics, extended history), B2B2C partnerships with schools

Technically, we run on React Native (Expo) with a backend ready for tRPC/Hono/PostgreSQL, 
and we're designing our KPIs around family activation, retention, feature usage, and prevented incidents.
Built‑in analytics track activation, retention (D1, D7, D30), feature usage, and premium capabilities.

In the US, new child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) are creating pressure 
for real age‑based controls and safety tooling. KIDS by KIKU is positioned as a practical 
infrastructure layer for this: age‑aware controls, risk analytics and auditable logs 
for families and platforms.

We are preparing a $500k–$1M seed round focused on:
- Moving from MVP to a stable product and acquiring the first 10–20k US families (free model)
- Running pilots with schools and platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Hardening our safety and engagement KPIs for the next funding stages
- Building the foundation for future premium features and B2B partnerships

If this is relevant to your EdTech / child safety / infrastructure thesis, 
I'd be glad to share a concise one‑pager and product demo, 
and discuss whether there is a fit for a 20–30 minute call.

Best regards,
