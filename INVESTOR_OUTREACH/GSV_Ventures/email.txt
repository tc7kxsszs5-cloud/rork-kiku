SUBJECT: KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning platform (Seed round, US focus)

Hi [Name/Team],

My name is Galoian Mikheil, I'm the founder of KIKU and the creator of KIDS by KIKU – 
a family app that combines online safety, healthy screen use and learning support 
for children, without turning parents into full‑time spies.

KIDS by KIKU monitors chats, messengers and games with AI, flags risky situations 
(bullying, grooming, self‑harm, explicit content) and gives parents clear, 
actionable alerts and SOS flows – while keeping the child's experience human and 
age‑appropriate.

In the US, we already see state‑level child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) 
that push platforms to add real age‑based controls and safety tooling. 
KIDS by KIKU is built as a practical layer for this reality: 
age‑aware restrictions, AI‑based risk scoring, audit logs and a parent dashboard 
that can sit on top of Apple/Google/Microsoft ecosystems and messaging platforms.

Our go‑to‑market strategy:
- **Free for families** at launch – our focus is rapid user acquisition and building critical mass
- We're targeting both parents and children as active users (doubling our addressable audience)
- This dual‑user model makes KIDS by KIKU unique: 1 family = 2–4 active users (parent + children)
- Future monetization: premium features (advanced analytics, extended history), B2B2C partnerships with schools

Where we are now:
- Working React Native (Expo) MVP with AI moderation and SOS mechanics
- Architecture ready for mobile + web + tRPC backend and PostgreSQL
- Built‑in analytics for activation, retention, feature usage, and premium capabilities
- Clear KPI model around family activation, retention and prevented incidents

We're preparing a $500k–$1M seed round to:
- Ship a production‑ready version and acquire the first 10–20k families (free model)
- Run pilots with schools / platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Formalize and track safety and engagement KPIs at a level investors can underwrite
- Build the foundation for future premium features and B2B partnerships

I know your time and pipeline are limited, so I'll keep it simple:
if this fits your EdTech / child safety / infrastructure thesis, 
I'd be happy to send a 1‑page overview and a short product demo, 
and explore a 20–30 minute call in the next couple of weeks.

Best,
Galoian Mikheil
