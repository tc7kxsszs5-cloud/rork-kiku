SUBJECT: KIDS by KIKU – AI child safety & learning platform for families (US & global)

KIDS by KIKU is a mobile and web app for families that acts as a safety and growth layer 
for children in the digital world.

We combine:
- AI‑based monitoring of chats, messengers and games
- Age‑aware restrictions and risk scoring
- SOS flows for the child and clear alerts for the parent
- A transparent parent dashboard instead of pure surveillance

The goal is to protect children from online harm (bullying, grooming, self‑harm, 
explicit content) and at the same time to support learning and healthy screen habits.

In the US we already see state‑level child online safety initiatives (including in Texas) 
that require real age‑based controls and tooling for parents and platforms. 
KIDS by KIKU is designed as practical infrastructure for this: 
age‑based controls, risk analytics and auditable logs that families and platforms can plug into.

Our go‑to‑market strategy:
- **Free for families** at launch – our focus is rapid user acquisition and building critical mass
- We're targeting both parents and children as active users (doubling our addressable audience)
- This dual‑user model makes KIDS by KIKU unique: 1 family = 2–4 active users (parent + children)
- Future monetization: premium features (advanced analytics, extended history), B2B2C partnerships with schools

We are currently preparing a $500k–$1M seed round to:
- Bring KIDS by KIKU from MVP to a robust product and acquire the first 10–20k families (free model)
- Run pilots with schools and platforms (Apple / Google / Microsoft ecosystems)
- Formalize and track safety and engagement KPIs (activation, retention, prevented incidents)
- Build the foundation for future premium features and B2B partnerships

We would love to explore whether KIDS by KIKU could fit your education / child safety / 
tech‑for‑good thesis, and whether there is a path to collaboration or funding.
