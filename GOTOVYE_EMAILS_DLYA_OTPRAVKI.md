Subject: KIDS: AI-powered child safety platform - Seed opportunity

Hi there,

I'm reaching out about KIDS, an AI-powered child safety platform we're building.

The Problem: Every third child faces online threats - cyberbullying, grooming, inappropriate content. Current solutions are reactive and ineffective.

Our Solution: KIDS combines real-time AI protection with education, teaching children safe behavior while protecting them. Our goal: become the pre-installed safety standard on all platforms (iOS, Android, browsers, messengers).

Why Reach Capital: Given your focus on EdTech and child-focused solutions, I thought KIDS might be a great fit for your portfolio.

Traction: 
- MVP is ready and working
- Production-ready code, COPPA/GDPR-K compliant
- Open Source approach

The Ask: We're seeking $500K-$1M (Seed round) to integrate on iOS, Android, browsers, and messengers, and scale to protect millions of children.

I'd love to share our vision and see if there's a fit. Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week?

Best regards,
