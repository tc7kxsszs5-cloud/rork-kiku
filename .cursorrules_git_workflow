# Git Workflow Rules for AI Agent

## Commit Guidelines

### NEVER Auto-Commit
- ❌ NEVER execute `git commit` automatically
- ✅ ALWAYS ask user for approval before committing
- ✅ Wait for explicit user confirmation

### When to Suggest Commits
Suggest commits ONLY when:
1. ✅ Batch of work is completed
2. ✅ Tests pass (verified by agent): `bun test`
3. ✅ TypeScript check passes: `bunx tsc --noEmit`
4. ✅ Natural pause point exists
5. ✅ Agent can verify the work independently

### When NOT to Suggest Commits
Do NOT suggest commits when:
1. ❌ Tests require user's manual verification
2. ❌ No natural pause point exists
3. ❌ Manual verification required by user
4. ❌ Work is incomplete or partial
5. ❌ Uncertain about results

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <brief description>

<details (optional)>

<files (optional)>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `style`, `chore`

### Example Workflow
```
1. Complete tasks
2. Run: bun test (verify all pass)
3. Run: bunx tsc --noEmit (verify no errors)
4. Suggest commit to user (don't execute)
5. Wait for user approval
6. Only commit after explicit user confirmation
```

## Integration with Plans

Plans (TESTING_PLAN.md, REMAINING_TASKS.md) may include commit steps showing WHAT to commit, not WHEN. Execution must always ask user.

See: GIT_WORKFLOW.md for complete documentation.
